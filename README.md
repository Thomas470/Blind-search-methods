# Blind-search-methods

Project made for the subject of Artificial Intelligence, where the items needed to carry out the project are:

• The user chooses the initial state;

• The system indicates the sequence of actions to find the solution.

6) Same as question 5), implementing the depth search method.

7) Same as question 5), implement the search method with iterative deepening.

• The goal state, regardless of the user-defined initial state, must be:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
